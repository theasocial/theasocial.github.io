  <h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system">Bulletin board systems</a> were the places where people used to gather together and discuss new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammoth">mammoth</a> hunt tricks, as well as to play board and mammoth hunt simulation games (since it was even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistoric_warfare#Paleolithic">before</a> the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War#History">invention of war</a>). Currently there is a possibility of mammoth <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De-extinction">de-extinction</a>, which may also bring the popularity of BBS back.</p>
<p>There were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUDs">MUDs</a> (predecessors of modern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game">MMORPGs</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum">message boards</a> and other messaging systems, news; pretty similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">WWW</a> overall, including the approach: both require a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_client">thin client</a> only – a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_terminal">computer terminal</a> in case of BBS, and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">web browser</a> in case of WWW.</p>
<p>But enough of history. Pick your favourite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator">terminal emulator</a>, recall its <a href="http://catern.com/posts/terminal_quirks.html">quirks</a>, prepare a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet">telnet</a> client, and let the journey begin!</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.telnetbbsguide.com/brieflist.asp">Quick Telnet BBS Listing</a> is a good starting point. Before experimenting, recall that it is usually <code>C-]</code> (<code>^]</code>, <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>]</code>) to escape to the normal telnet escape prompt, where you can type <code>quit</code>, and there is <code>tput</code> to reset the colors: <code>tput reset</code> (or <code>tput init</code>). Some BBS will assume that your terminal is 80x24 characters (imagine how modern websites would look like in a few decades – not only they tend to assume certain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_resolution">display resolution</a> range, but most of them also assume certain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_per_inch">DPI</a>!), so it is better to set the 80x24 mode. Most of them will ask for your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonym">pseudonym</a>, so make something up beforehand if it takes you some time – otherwise you may get disconnected while thinking.</p>
<p>There is a lot of BBS, which makes it nearly impossible to try them all in a reasonable amount of time, hence one should choose wisely. The stategy we employ here is the same as for wine bottles: picking the ones with the most amusing labels. It is mostly about pictures in case of wine (always works, by the way: each time it turns out to be wine in them), and about domain names in case of BBS.</p>

<p>Runs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWIV">WWIV</a>, hosts a bunch of games (including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_of_the_Red_Dragon">LORD</a>), a mailing system, conference and file exchange functionality – pretty usual, and with very few users. The time is limited to 60 minutes – as usual, too; a weird and unfortunate, seemingly legacy restriction, alas very common among BBS. Only textual messages indicate that it is maintained in this century (even in this month, to be fair).</p>

<p>Runs modern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronet">Synchronet</a> software, which provides plenty of settings, detects and properly uses some of the terminal emulator parameters, and provides access to some of its features via specialized protocols – such as POP3, FTP, and IRC.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p>It can emulate various other BBS interfaces, and is relatively cool, though the functionality is pretty much the same as everywhere: messages and boards, games, files. The time limit is 4 hours.</p>
<h3 id="braintoys.org">braintoys.org</h3>
<p>A few games, forum, chat, some old-looking engine, files; another common BBS.</p>

<p>One more Synchronet BBS, with “fancy” design – that is, the accesibility is poor. Nevertheless, Synchronet BBS are cool, and here is a few more screenshots:</p>

<p>Not exactly a BBS, but “a text-based simulation of an early version of the Internet”.</p>
<h3 id="busy-and-broken-ones">Busy and broken ones</h3>
<p>Some of the BBS were too busy being BBS to serve us at the time of writing, and some mess up the pseudographics, or require a verification by mail, which made them unusable.</p>
<h2 id="sole-journey">Sole journey</h2>
<p>Now you should know what to expect, and may continue this journey alone – there is plenty of games to find, and probably less common BBS features are lurking there somewhere, waiting to be discovered.</p>
