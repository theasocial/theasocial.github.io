  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Never before it was so easy to share knowledge: currently it takes moments and costs approximately nothing to send a book copy to the other side of the planet. You can just get a lot of books on any topic, skim those and look for suitable ones, or pick random ones to read, or find the ones you need – better than any offline library, not only in that you can do it anytime and from any computer connected to the internet.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, computers are not always connected to the internet, search engines tend to throw fraud and commercial sites instead of books, some governments block libraries, and others do threat to put you into a jail with rape for “piracy”. Not a big deal, but not particularly convenient; better to know where the books are.</p>
<h2 id="project-gutenberg">Project Gutenberg</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a> is a nice library, especially for recreational reading: it is all legal, hence books get there when their copyright expires; a lot of useful information gets outdated by that time. For offline reading (as well as for backup purposes), it provides <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:The_CD_and_DVD_Project#What_the_Discs_Contain">CD images</a>, though even less books are there.</p>
<p>There are somewhat similar libraries, e.g. <a href="http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/">The Online Books Page</a>, but usually it’s even harder to find anything useful there.</p>
<h2 id="internet-archive">Internet Archive</h2>
<p><a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> provides <a href="https://archive.org/details/texts">tons of texts</a>, including books, among other cool things. <a href="https://archive.org/about/faqs.php#21">Its mission</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most societies place importance on preserving artifacts of their culture and heritage. Without such artifacts, civilization has no memory and no mechanism to learn from its successes and failures. Our culture now produces more and more artifacts in digital form. The Archive’s mission is to help preserve those artifacts and create an Internet library for researchers, historians, and scholars. The Archive collaborates with institutions including the Library of Congress and the Smithsonian.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="wikibooks">Wikibooks</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wikibooks.org/">Wikibooks</a> is a very promising project, yet there is very few finished books by now – when it comes to maths, at least. Since even those are not guaranteed to be the best for you, it is not the most useful library for now; hopefully, it will be in the future.</p>
<h2 id="wikipedia">Wikipedia</h2>
<p>Though <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> is not a library, its printed version would consist of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Size_in_volumes">a couple of thousands of volumes</a>, which would make a small library. The best part here is that it’s a great encyclopedia, which you can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Database_download">download</a> – to be prepared for a zombie apocalypse, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_of_Wikipedia">censorship of Wikipedia</a>, internet connection issues; or simply to have lower latency.</p>
<h2 id="papers-and-collections">Papers and collections</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access">Open access</a> is a particularly important thing, which provides free access to important research results to everyone. Those are not educational books, of course, and one should be familiar with a field in order to read those, yet there is much more exciting and modern things in papers than there is in educational books – since papers are basically the sources from which those books are assembled. There is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open_access_journals">list of open access journals</a> in Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, some papers can only be bought (most notably, JSTOR sells them), though there is <a href="http://arxiv.org/">arXiv.org</a>, where papers are freely available, as well as those open access journals, various university websites, and researchers’ homepages.</p>
<p>There also are topical collections of papers and free books – either links or file collections. A few examples which you can <code>clone</code>, about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_theory">PLT</a> and programming languages: <a href="https://github.com/steshaw/plt">steshaw/plt</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ocharles/papers">ocharles/papers</a>, <a href="https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books">vhf/free-programming-books</a>.</p>
<h2 id="bittorrent-trackers">BitTorrent trackers</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pirate_Bay">The Pirate Bay</a> (<a href="https://thepiratebay.se/">thepiratebay.se</a>, <a href="https://thepiratebay.gd/">thepiratebay.gd</a>), <a href="https://kat.cr/">Kickass Torrents</a>, as well as specialized search engines, such as <a href="https://torrentz.eu/">torrentz.eu</a>, may help you to find many books; often it is easier to find a specific book there, than by using a general-purpose web search engine.</p>
<h2 id="offline-libraries">Offline libraries</h2>
<p>The thing about offline libraries is that you can pick, skim, and read anything, anytime, and for free; it can also be written onto a device that fits into your pocket. Unfortunately, it is too good to be legal, so we won’t risk to provide the links or hashes. But here is a few names of mathematical libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>The MYRIAD Mathematical Library</code>: around 11 GB of pure (and applied) awesomeness.</li>
<li><code>-- mit math</code>: 2 GB of that.</li>
<li><code>MATH MATHEMATICS BOOK COLLECTION</code>: almost 10 GB.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tor-network-libraries">Tor network libraries</h2>
<p><a href="http://zqktlwi4fecvo6ri.onion/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">The Hidden Wiki</a> has a page for <a href="http://zqktlwi4fecvo6ri.onion/wiki/Libraries">libraries</a>; though one may think that anonymity leads to great libraries, in fact it is not necessarily the case. Yet, there are nice ones, <a href="http://clockwise3rldkgu.onion/">Clockwise Libraries</a> in particular.</p>
