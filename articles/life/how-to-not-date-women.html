  <p>Every one of us has this dream of never ever meeting “that special someone”. Living our lives solely dedicated to our own selves is definitely the best we can hope for. Nobody to hurt us, no responsibilities, no stress…</p>
<p>For those of you who have found a way to reach that “nirvana” and be introverted to the point where you don’t even have to open your mouth for anything else but for shoving down your throat food which you order online, this article may seem like a nice reminder about how truly happy you are and how full of yourself your life is. As for everyone else, this is a collection of the best tips and ideas on how to improve the quality of your life, shut yourself away from any kind of interaction with the opposite gender and maybe even make you experience the best feeling known to humankind: love towards oneself.</p>
<p>Before we start, let me introduce myself to you. I’m a professional loner. Some call me names like “loser” or “porn addict”. I don’t care about those silly names they give me. Actually, I do care, and it hurts me deep down inside. Scars, even. But I pretend like it doesn’t because the same moment I start being honest with myself and accept obvious truths I will have to turn into one of those responsible adults who actually live their lives and solve problems. I don’t want that. Why? Because solving problems is an infinite process, you can spend your whole life solving problems, and guess what? You’re gonna die at the end no matter how hard you try anyway! The solution is simple: give up on life right from the start! It worked for me, worked for hundreds, even thousands (counting as you read this) of my clients over the past eight years since I started helping people. I like calling myself not-dating coach aka PDA (put-down artist).</p>
<p>At some point in your life you will realize that when people told you that there’s nobody else to take care of yourself but you, were actually completely serious. You are an amazing and a beautiful human being. But just for the sake of revenge to the rest of the world (and specifically your objects of affection who never cared enough about you to actually give a damn whether you’re alive or dead) you should continue going in a way of not taking care of yourself. It’s their fault, let this world suffer from never having you since it refused to baby you and instead has given those nasty challenges which could make your life interesting!</p>
