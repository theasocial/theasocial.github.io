  <h2 id="biases">Biases</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias">Biases</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias">cognitive biases</a> in particular, are rather nasty things: they make your judgment and memory unreliable, and can be used for manipulation (well, that’s what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing">marketing</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics">politics</a> are about). It may be useful to go through a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases">list of cognitive biases</a> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_memory_biases">list of memory biases</a> from time to time, in order to learn or recall them, and possibly to catch them once they will show up. It is virtually impossible to avoid making mistakes if you are doing anything, those memory biases are especially nasty, and it is possible to run into overcompensation, yet there is a hope to overcome at least some of them.</p>
<h2 id="fallacies">Fallacies</h2>
<p>As biases correspond to being a human, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy">fallacies</a> correspond to being stupid (and perhaps ignorant) – so it is easier to work on. There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_fallacy">formal fallacies</a>, which can be ruled out by logic<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> alone, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_fallacy">informal fallacies</a>, which bring additional ambiguity. Nevertheless, the examples from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies">list of fallacies</a> should be useful to go through.</p>
<h2 id="misconceptions">Misconceptions</h2>
<p>Those are harder to define, but perhaps even easier to get rid of: it is just about knowledge. One definition would be “an erroneous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief">belief</a> that is currently widely held about a notable topic”, but it is not clear whether things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoscience">pseudoscience</a> should be included, so we will put them into a separate group: in most cases they are more obviously erroneous than those listed in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_misconceptions">list of common misconceptions</a> from Wikipedia.</p>
<h2 id="weirdness">Weirdness</h2>
<p>There are beliefs — sometimes surprisingly common, and sometimes just hoaxes — which are beyond reason<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, so they do not belong here as a checklist. Yet some of them are amusing and may be used to create, say, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_fantasy">high fantasy</a> game universes. The relevant lists include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_topics_characterized_as_pseudoscience">topics characterized as pseudoscience</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_religions_and_spiritual_traditions">religions and spiritual traditions</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Superstitions">superstitions</a>; superstitions and older religions are used in various movies and games, while pseudoscience makes fine sci-fi movies.</p>
<p>Among less known things, there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_flat_Earth_societies">modern flat Earth societies</a>, which picture <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth">Earth</a> as a disc: with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pole">North Pole</a> in the middle, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pole">South Pole</a> being an ice wall. Satellite images of Earth are explained as incorrectly interpreted, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_landing_conspiracy_theories">moon landings – as a hoax</a>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite">satellites</a> themselves – as a hoax as well, while their tasks are explained to be achieved by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airship">airships</a>. Not the least creative theory, though neither it is the most creative one. But what it provides is inspiration: now you can grab “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Brief_History_of_Time">a brief history of time</a>” for a fine scientific setting and a hang of change in views, then mix in some fantasy and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology">topology</a> to morph it into something amusing, and lose the ends in maths or made up experiments. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_conspiracy_theories">list of conspiracy theories</a> would provide an inspiration for explanations, in case if you want it to be based on our world, and you are ready to make up relatively-well-founded universes – something with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technomancy">technomancy</a>, perhaps! Well, there also are other things which may be handy for that, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superseded_scientific_theories">obsolete scientific theories</a> and existing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe">fictional universes</a>, but let’s get back to our fallacies.</p>
<h2 id="lesswrong">LessWrong</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LessWrong">LessWrong</a> (<a href="http://lesswrong.com/">lesswrong.com</a>) provides a lot of <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationality_materials">materials on rationality</a>. Although some of them may be rather obvious, they are still interesting to read, and less obvious things are described there as well.</p>
