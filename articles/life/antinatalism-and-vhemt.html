  <p>Ever wondered how nice it would be if everyone would die at once, in order to avoid any grief? Although it is unlikely to happen, there are more realistic alternatives: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_Human_Extinction_Movement">Voluntary Human Extinction Movement</a> (<a href="http://vhemt.org/">VHEMT</a>, «vehement») suggests to cease breeding, in order to extinct gradually. “What is in it for me?” – you may wonder; not much, actually: their goal is to save the environment, and it would only help future generations to not exist – rather selfless thing overall.</p>
<p>To put it straight, VHEMT is all about environment, not really about reducing human suffering, while the latter may just come as a side effect. A broader philosophical position is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinatalism">antinatalism</a>, which just “assigns a negative value to birth”; the reasons behind that may include environmental concern, as well as moral responsibility, based on premises, such as the <a href="http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199296422.001.0001/acprof-9780199296422">following</a>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The presence of pain is bad.</li>
<li>The presence of pleasure is good.</li>
<li>The absence of pain is good, even if that good is not enjoyed by anyone.</li>
<li>The absence of pleasure is not bad unless there is somebody for whom this absence is a deprivation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Such views are not new, and were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silenus#The_wisdom_of_Silenus">mentioned</a> by Aristotle a while ago – back when he was alive:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For he lives with the least worry who knows not his misfortune; but for humans, the best for them is not to be born at all, not to partake of nature’s excellence; not to be is best, for both sexes. This should our choice, if choice we have; and the next to this is, when we are born, to die as soon as we can.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fortunately, procreation may be both less desirable and easier to avoid for an asocial person.</p>
