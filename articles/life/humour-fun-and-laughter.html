<div id="article">
  <p>We have decided to write about something cheerful, so here is three topics at once: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humour">humour</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fun">fun</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laughter">laughter</a>. They all may be somewhat mysterious and hard to define, though Wikipedia does that.</p>
<h2 id="humour">Humour</h2>
<p>There are various kinds of humour, and various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theories_of_humor">theories of humour</a>, but it seems to be more or less common in them that unexpected stuff is funny. And it also is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coping_%28psychology%29">coping</a> mechanism, providing you relief. One of the oldest theories states that humour is about feeling superiority: you laugh when you see that somebody is acting stupid or suffers; this theory seems to cover most of the funny things, though it may also depend on personal taste. Also explains why <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snuff_film">snuff</a> got mixed with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy">comedies</a>.</p>
<h2 id="fun">Fun</h2>
<p>As Wikipedia states, fun is an experience, related to enjoyment of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleasure">pleasure</a>, whereas pleasure may be a lot of things, and often it is something you seek. In many cases it is also easy to link to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution">evolution</a>: one usually finds enjoyable the things that helped previous generations to survive. So, basically it is supposed to be fun to survive and prosper.</p>
<h2 id="laughter">Laughter</h2>
<p>One of the versions of the cause of death of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysippus">Chrysippus</a> (the guy from the picture, a Greek <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism">Stoic</a> philosopher) is that he <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_from_laughter">died from laughter</a>. So, one use of laughter is to send something really funny by mail, following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kaczynski">Unabomber</a> – just using different technologies. Actually, it seems that he does exactly that now, from the prison: “On May 24, 2012, Kaczynski submitted his current information to the Harvard University alumni association. He listed his eight life sentences as awards, his current occupation as prisoner.”</p>
<p>Seriously though, laughter is mostly a social thing, usually caused by humour or other positive emotions, such as joy. Points out that a group of laughing people understands something in the same way, probably is relaxed (hence friendly), and so on.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smile">Smile</a> appears to be related to laughter, though it is not the same thing.</p>
<p>Note that the interpretation of those differs among cultures: say, websites filled with fake smiles seem to be considered appealing in the webdev culture – especially in its corporate and Indian parts, while in sad ex-USSR countries smiling in public is considered suspicious for obvious reasons: you don’t know what to expect from a person who smiles while being in there. Some of the Asian folks may smile when they are in emotional pain, making it pretty weird.</p>
