<div id="article">
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Robot_%28TV_series%29">Mr. Robot</a> is a rather good show about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_hacker">security hacking</a> and other loosely related things, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_anxiety_disorder">SAD</a>.</p>
<p>The prominent feature of this show is its connection to reality: there is actual software instead of 3-dimensional interfaces, and the protagonist is at least somewhat <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geek">geeky</a>. Though it is not really new, for there were series such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scene_%28miniseries%29">The Scene</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_IT_Crowd">The IT Crowd</a>, and perhaps <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lone_Gunmen_%28TV_series%29">The Lone Gunmen</a>, Mr. Robot might be the first show to combine geeky characters with real software. Well, except for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory">The Big Bang Theory</a>. But maybe it’s still the first to do it to such extent.</p>
<p>The plot itself is quite decent, though the first major plot twist appears to be borrowed from another movie, which is rather strange. The show itself tells a continued story – not just the same plot with variables filled with different values from episode to episode. However, once you get used to reality in a show, you may begin to expect accuracy and plausibility, but that’s where the show gets worse. There are clichés, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet">leetspeak</a> in both writing and speech, to begin with. Then there is software: the protagonist is supposed to be experienced and geeky, so one would expect him to be using both efficient and advanced tools. But what we observe is mouse-driven <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME">GNOME</a>, sometimes with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_nano">nano</a><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> in a terminal emulator. Though it may be argued that GNOME is being featured there because of it being the default desktop environment for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali_Linux">Kali</a> GNU/Linux distribution, or because it allows one to just focus on the job without dealing with WM and system configuration manually, nano on top of that makes little sense: there is basically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war">two advanced text editors</a>, and nano is not one of them. Even for a newbie user, it would not make much sense to use GNOME, and then nano in a terminal emulator: there is gedit for such users. To be fair, it seems that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi">vi</a> is also used sometimes, but sometimes there’s also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_%28operating_system%29">Ubuntu</a>. Although, it may be a matter of taste, and something overly geeky would probably also look like a cliché.</p>
<p>In S02E06, they are preparing a newbie to attack FBI. Here is a hilarious screen:</p>
<pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~/exploit_dev/bin# ./EnableAttack femtoponWLAN
Usage: ./EnableAttack &lt;attack name&gt; &lt;interfaces&gt; &lt;timing&gt;
root@OpenWrt:~/exploit_dev/bin# ./EnableAttack femtopwn WLANWLAN22
Usage: ./EnableAttack &lt;attack name&gt; &lt;interfaces&gt; &lt;timing&gt;
root@OpenWrt:~/exploit_dev/bin#</code></pre>
<p>Then the guy who is teaching the newbie suggests to visualize the attack, showing pictures of the devices. And dictates the command: “period, forward slash, enable attack, space, femtopwn, space, WLAN0, comma, WLAN1, space, two”. The screen again:</p>
<pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~/exploit_dev/bin# ./EnableAttack femtoponWLAN
Usage: ./EnableAttack &lt;attack name&gt; &lt;interfaces&gt; &lt;timing&gt;
root@OpenWrt:~/exploit_dev/bin# ./EnableAttack femtopwn WLANWLAN22
Usage: ./EnableAttack &lt;attack name&gt; &lt;interfaces&gt; &lt;timing&gt;
root@OpenWrt:~/exploit_dev/bin# ./EnableAttack femtopwn WLAN1WLAN22
Usage: ./EnableAttack &lt;attack name&gt; &lt;interfaces&gt; &lt;timing&gt;
root@OpenWrt:~/exploit_dev/bin#</code></pre>
<p>Though it is funny, and mental disability of the hacker-to-be may be assumed without hurting the plot, it is rather hard to imagine why wouldn’t they just set a shell script instead of making the poor kid who can neither write what’s dictated nor read the instructions to memorize the commands, without any understanding.</p>
<p>“I will get this. Let’s just try it again.” – says the future hacker with a serious face after another failure, apparently implying that she doesn’t get that the problem is that she keeps making typos. In the next scene, the teacher complains: “You can’t teach someone to hack in one day, okay?”, suggesting that “to hack” is “to type without typos”. That for sure takes some time to learn.</p>
<p>A bit later, they use the same rookie as a modem, not just as a shell script. Apparently it all is intended to add visible thrill and human interaction to the process, just as the infamous 3D interfaces are.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the show is rather pleasant to watch.</p>
