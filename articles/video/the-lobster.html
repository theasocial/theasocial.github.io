  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lobster">The Lobster</a> is a movie made by a few European countries, but reminds primarily of French movies – such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrong_%28film%29">Wrong</a>, for instance, though that one is French-American. Somehow their French parts take over all the time: perhaps that’s because they are distinguishably weird and absurd, and look like they are made by kids alone. Plot, sound effects, perhaps even acting – pretty much everything looks that way. They are “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_film">independent</a>” most of the time, tend to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealism">surreal</a> and full of metaphors (or just some random stuff that can be interpreted as you wish; metaphors suck), and characters act even more stupid than those in Hollywood horror movies.</p>
<p>This movie is not an exception, and it is also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystopia">dystopian</a>, what may make it more or less worthwhile to spend your time on watching. Though its sound effects are really bad and loud, and it is long, as many other boring movies tend to be: most of the 2-hour movies barely have enough of the plot for 10-30 minutes, and many independent films actually are 10-30 minutes long. Probably sometimes they are like “hey, we have more tape left – let’s make it longer”, or “let’s not cut anything, it’s too wasteful to throw away our work”.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to watch it is in background – that is, with another window over it. And definitely without sound, since it is very bad and loud, as was mentioned above. Another option is just to turn it off and remove altogether at the moment when it’ll cross your mind: the movie doesn’t get better as it progresses.</p>
<p>Usually I am seeding a lot, or at least until the 1.0 ratio if a movie is bad, but removed this one as soon as I finished watching it, and felt good about doing so. I feel fooled and robbed of time, so don’t repeat my mistakes.</p>
