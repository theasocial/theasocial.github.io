  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Game_High_School">VGHS</a> pictures a place where people just play computer games all day long, and they call it a school. It may look fun, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESports">professional gaming</a> is a thing, and as professional sports in general, it sucks all the joy out of games, turning those into income sources and stressful jobs for gamers, weird amusement and gambling opportunity for the masses, and marketing opportunity for companies. But the show does not bring up the sad bits of professional gaming, keeping it rather lighthearted.</p>
<p>The next thing that you notice is exaggregation of pretty much everything – as in caricatures, or in those asian cartoons. There’s almost no realistic characters, but that makes the show rather fun. It’s also quite interesting how that works out: sometimes the characters act so cute, pretentious, or silly that it may make you to smile and laugh.</p>
<p>The main character (portrayed by the actor known for such roles as Bartender, Tea Guest, Boy on Bike, Guy, and Douche) is rather annoying: he is a disgusting kind of nerd, dully reacting to the things that happen around, which is probably supposed to be relatable. Plenty of nice things happen to him from the very beginning, which is the plot of every asian cartoon, as I’ve heard. To elaborate on the “disgusting” part: it’s the kind of disgusting where you suspect that the actor has a few different health issues, and that it wouldn’t be nice to criticize him for that. It’s good that I don’t care.</p>
<p>Following the annoying tradition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron">TRON</a>, during the games, the characters are placed in a game world, but somehow it’s not that bad, even though doesn’t always make sense. The plot twists are predictable sometimes, but then again – the show isn’t supposed to be taken seriously, so that’s fine.</p>
<p>The season structure makes it closer to regular shows: the first season is okay, the second one is probably the most fun, and the third one deals with boring character relationships. Fortunately, it ended before getting even worse; actually it’d be disappointing if it ended when it was good, so ending after a decay is a rather nice way out.</p>
<p>The show is available for free on <code>youtube-dl https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsMtUWKCmBPRFzqglpk4YQlNFy8wzSXBN</code>.</p>
