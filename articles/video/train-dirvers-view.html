  <p>As was <a href="../../articles/games/openttd.html">stated previously</a>, trains are awesome and everybody loves them. Some of us want to be more like them, too; others just prefer their company to that of meatbags. And some are just in it to watch landscapes, but everyone can enjoy live <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUPn5IEQugMf_JeNJOV9p2A">train driverâ€™s view</a> these days, from multiple trains! No more cut-outs when a meatbag gets in a trainâ€™s way, just raw train experience.</p>
<p>There are snowy mountains, lakes, forests, tunnels, bridges, sky, clouds, mist, snow, rain, fellow trains, a whole set of railroad equipment â€“ all at a nice speed, with accelerations, decelerations, and sound. Pretty much everything one needs to effortlessly imagine being a train all day long, every day â€“ without even getting through train driver school (and everyone canâ€™t be a train driver anyway: there are all the dull jobs that have to be done, too; though probably in a fair society it could have been arranged so that everyone had their shift or few as a train driver).</p>
<p>Awesome as it is, there are some technical issues here: for some reason these streams are hosted on youtube, and <code>youtube-dl</code> doesnâ€™t handle live streams, so one has to use a crappy web interface complete with a live chat full of retards (one can try to hide it, but itâ€™ll still blink with parts of messages because of the crappy web UI; <a href="../../articles/internet/top-4-websites.html">Google keeps screwing it up</a>) to watch the videos. But thatâ€™s a bit less of an issue if you watch those in full screen, as one should for uninterrupted train experience.</p>
