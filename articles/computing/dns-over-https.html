<div id="article">
  <p>Google has spawned another monster, <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/dns-over-https">DNS over HTTPS</a>. <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/FirefoxNoNightly">Mozilla already experiments on Firefox Nightly users</a> with sending their private data to <a href="../../articles/cloudflare.html">Cloudflare</a>, which is another one of early adopters. It’s probably time to start panicking, since that may be the future of DNS.</p>
<h2 id="brief-dns-history">Brief DNS history</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS">DNS</a> usually works on top of UDP, though TCP is used for more important requests, and is defined even in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1034">RFC 1034</a> from 1987, as well as in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc883">RFC 883</a> from 1983. It’s pretty simple and minimal, but lacks any means for verification and encryption, allowing a variety of attacks – as early network protocols did in general. Many of those are now used on top of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a> instead of TCP, which is a relatively easy transition.</p>
<p>But not DNS.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions">DNSSEC</a> is an ongoing (since 1990s) effort to get DNS records signed by their authors without piggybacking on X.509 PKI (which <a href="../../internet/the-trustico-clusterfuck.html">has</a> its own <a href="../../internet/letsencrypt-public-beta.html">issues</a>) or anything else. Turns out it’s not such an easy task in the world where we can barely type, transmit, <em>or</em> display text messages, but after a few attempts they’ve got it more or less working on limited deployments. And it still doesn’t provide encryption.</p>
<h2 id="a-new-proposal">A new proposal</h2>
<p>Apparently <a href="systemd.html">Poettering</a> was busy, so Google decided to step in: get the poor thing, and add the needed features, but in the worst way imaginable – if you have a good imagination, that is.</p>
<p>Just adding TLS would be a no-brainer, but Google had to come up with a way to make it more awkward and ads-friendly at once. So they’ve wrapped it in HTTP and in JSON, apparently targeting in-browser JS: no more simple system-wide hosts-based blocking of ads and trackers.</p>
<p>Then they’ve decided to have some fun with the corpse of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model">the OSI model</a>, by engaging into the popular activity of turning the layers inside out, and duplicating their functionality: meet <code>random_padding</code> inside JSON, on top of HTTP, on top of TLS, which by itself can (and should) handle it!</p>
<p>Our <a href="../../articles/internet/pimp-my-code-issue-3.html">Pimp My Code</a> team still has a thing or two to learn from those guys.</p>
