  <p><a href="http://www.driver-aces.com/ronnie.html#dunnet">Dunnet</a> is a rather old text adventure, which is free, portable, and often comes with Emacs. During the adventure, you will discover a surreal cyberpunk world, as well as new limits of boredom – in case if you like cyberpunk, that is; hard to imagine what the experience would be otherwise. If you think that you are desperate enough and can not be bored more, then you probably have a chance to go through it, or at least to learn more about your feelings.</p>
<p>Another lesson to learn from this game is that interactive versions of things (of fiction, in this case) are not necessarily more fun than non-interactive ones: though you have choices, they are lame, and it is mostly about bruteforcing the options. Of course, there is some sense of achievement when solving a riddle and advancing, yet one can achieve something real with equal effort and more fun in the process.</p>
<p>Despite that, it is one of the best games which I have managed to play in the past couple of years, hence highly recommended to kill your time.</p>
