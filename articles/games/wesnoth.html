  <p><a href="http://wesnoth.org/">The Battle for Wesnoth</a> is a turn-based strategy game. There is very few games of such quality among <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open_source_games">open-source ones</a>: though it looks dated, and there is plenty to improve, it uses a sane build system and not too many dependencies, making it easy to install if it’s not available in your system repositories. It’s also written in C++, and should run on many systems, beyond Linux and BSD.</p>
<p>The game is quite simplistic in some aspects (say, gold is the only resource there), yet fun and challenging – perhaps because of the battle mechanics that are not that simplistic: some units fight better at day or at night, many of them are affected by terrain type, they level up, there always is randomness, and a bunch of other things. The graphics are fine, for it doesn’t try to do anything too fancy: just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_%28computer_graphics%29">sprites</a> with appropriate graphics, and more of occasional art to accompany cutscenes. Nice music, too.</p>
<p>Fantasy theme is used, featuring orcs, elves, humans, and other factions. The setting is not particularly original or outstanding, yet it’s done nicely.</p>
<p>There is a variety of scenarios (or campaigns), so one can easily kill a lot of time with it.</p>
<p>Here is how it looks like:</p>

<p>Overall, the game is well worth trying.</p>
