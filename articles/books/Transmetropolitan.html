<div id="article">
  <p>Our new “books” category begins with something that isn’t exactly a book, but a comic book. Or series of those, depending on what you count as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book">comic book</a>. Anyway, that’s a collection of pictures with little text.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmetropolitan">Transmetropolitan</a> (the plot of which wikipedia spoils, as it always does) story is set in the future, and follows a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzo_journalism">gonzo journalist</a> in his adventures. It is themed with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk">cyberpunk</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism">transhumanism</a>, what makes it rather fun.</p>
<p>The plot is not particularly original: it’s mostly about a government messing with common people; one of those old and typical plots, and something you can regularly see in the news if you care to follow those. Well, perhaps a journalist successfully fighting it is an original idea, or at least unrealistic enough to make the works of that kind unpopular, making it hard to come by those. Though there were superhero comics with superheroes also being journalists; let’s say it is an unusual combination of the things you may find elsewhere. The concept of a messiah (a popular story theme from the time when even the books were rare, still utilized by popular religions) can be seen there, too, what looks rather unnecessary.</p>
<p>Despite the plot’s naive bits, including the antagonists being absolute evil, the details are still nice and entertaining. Should be particularly nice for kids, but the atmosphere makes it readable and enjoyable by adults as well.</p>
