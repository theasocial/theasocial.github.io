  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushing_Daisies">Pushing Daisies</a> is a cute fairy tale. The characters are quirky and nice, the dialogues are interesting and not realistic, the colors are bright. There’s plenty of other minor and amusing bits, which make the series pretty wonderful when they are put together.</p>
<p>Though there are goofs, at least some of which are pointed out on IMDB, they can be ignored rather easily, since the fantasy bits are explained plainly as “magic”, not “sci-fi”.</p>
<p>The story revolves around the pie maker, who is also a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necromancy">necromancer</a>. He applies his skills to revive products for pies, and to assist a private investigator in the forensics by reviving dead people and asking who killed them.</p>
<p>It is well worth watching.</p>

<div id="article">
  <p>As <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/article/kat-alleged-founder-arrested">Wired</a> and <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/07/kickasstorrents-alleged-founder-artem-vaulin-arrested-in-poland/">Ars Technica</a> have reported, Artem Vaulin was recently arrested for being the <a href="https://kat.am/">Kickass Torrents</a> founder. There was lots of noise because KAT was stealing imaginary profit from movie companies, or something like that. In any case, what’s really interesting when such a thing happens, is how exactly he was identified; what was his mistake.</p>
<p>Though Wired and Ars Technica provide some information about his mistakes, it appears to differ, so let’s better read the actual <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2996082/Artem-Vaulin-Complaint.pdf">complaint</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-investigation">The Investigation</h2>
<p>As one may think, somebody who owns a large torrent tracker should be extremely careful, sometimes even paranoid, since their actions make big companies unhappy. By not preventing users from using their service, they are being an accomplice in the unspeakable crime of file sharing.</p>
<p>Then there should be a fatal slip, where they get identified by a writing style, or by a small piece of information that accidently leaks to a server accessible by a law enforcement agency, or sold by a person they’ve trusted, or timing of their actions allowed to trace the packets to their ISP… well, nothing of that sort has taken place this time.</p>
<p>One day, using KAT, HSI special agents found, downloaded, and watched the following movies: Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice, Captain America: Civil War, Central Intelligence, Deadpool, Finding Dory, Independence Day: Resurgence, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows, X-Men Apocalypse, and Now You See Me 2. Apparently they liked the movies very much, concluded that those should cost at least a million dollars combined. Since Homeland Security had nothing better to do, they’ve opened an investigation.</p>
<p>A special agent, extensively using his or her training and experience, based on which he or she knows great many things, found the following subtle clues:</p>
<ul>
<li>KAT “people” page mentioned at least the owner’s nickname, which was also used for personal mail addresses, when real name wasn’t used (in addresses themselves; was still filled everywhere).</li>
<li>KAT servers didn’t use any disk encryption, easily providing bits of identifying information and helpful evidence.</li>
<li>A fake company was used as a front, with a LinkedIn presence, with real names and photos.</li>
<li>Payments went through regular banks, with records available to the investigator.</li>
<li>Public whois data of a KAT domain registered to Vaulin, with his phone number and address.</li>
<li>Other KAT domains on the same GoDaddy account.</li>
<li>Vaulin’s personal mailboxes on public mail services (Apple’s in particular), with unencrypted KAT-related letters, tons of private information filled, Vaulin’s passport, driver’s license, personal banking information.</li>
<li>A Coinbase account for KAT donations, with real name, address, and that Apple email filled.</li>
<li>Logs of access to the KAT facebook account from the same IP as to the Apple account with the mailbox that contained all the private information, as well as from the same IP that was used to access the Coinbase account.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s when special agent UC-1, by putting it all together, started becoming suspicious of Vaulin: “he might be involved into KAT!”, thought the agent. Further investigation and additional clues added to the suspicion, and Vaulin, despite all his security measures, was finally captured in Poland.</p>
<p>Though it’s not clear how exactly Artem was captured, but judging by his overall secrecy and preparation, one may guess how hard it was: he probably was running naked around a police station and screaming, so the authorities had to besiege the city, as well as to bring a couple of helicopters and a tank, while Poland was targeted by nuclear missiles as a plan B, yet was saved in the last moment, and the villian was finally captured. UC-1 rode a Harley into the sunset, got a promotion, and lived happily ever after.</p>
<h2 id="aftermath">Aftermath</h2>
<p>Wired and Ars Technica call Artem an “alleged founder”, for it’s still to be proved in court. Indeed, perhaps the only way for all this to make sense is if it’ll turn out that Vaulin’s identity has been stolen and used for years by an actual founder, who is not mentally challenged. Yet it is likely that Vaulin will face a big sentence to learn how it feels when your property gets “illegaly shared”, getting an owner of his own instead of being one.</p>
<p>This is a lesson to us all: think twice before stealing priceless masterpieces.</p>
<p>As usual, random officials make <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndil/pr/owner-most-visited-illegal-file-sharing-website-charged-criminal-copyright-infringement">bullshit statements</a>.</p>

<div id="article">
  <p><a href="http://wesnoth.org/">The Battle for Wesnoth</a> is a turn-based strategy game. There is very few games of such quality among <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open_source_games">open-source ones</a>: though it looks dated, and there is plenty to improve, it uses a sane build system and not too many dependencies, making it easy to install if it’s not available in your system repositories. It’s also written in C++, and should run on many systems, beyond Linux and BSD.</p>
<p>The game is quite simplistic in some aspects (say, gold is the only resource there), yet fun and challenging – perhaps because of the battle mechanics that are not that simplistic: some units fight better at day or at night, many of them are affected by terrain type, they level up, there always is randomness, and a bunch of other things. The graphics are fine, for it doesn’t try to do anything too fancy: just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_%28computer_graphics%29">sprites</a> with appropriate graphics, and more of occasional art to accompany cutscenes. Nice music, too.</p>
<p>Fantasy theme is used, featuring orcs, elves, humans, and other factions. The setting is not particularly original or outstanding, yet it’s done nicely.</p>
<p>There is a variety of scenarios (or campaigns), so one can easily kill a lot of time with it.</p>
<p>Here is how it looks like:</p>

<div id="article">
  <p>It is amusing how poorly performed things make you to think and to learn more than good ones. Take <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_%282009_TV_series%29">V (2009)</a>, for example: sci-fi series, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inara_Serra#Inara_Serra">the Companion from Firefly</a> and spaceships, which may seem like a good thing to kill your time. If you are experienced enough in watching movies, you may tolerate poor CGIs, but then comes the absurd plot that would require more than that in order to watch the series. It’s like a parallel universe where people are even more stupid than in this one: nobody questions why the aliens look exactly like humans (the CGIs suggest that they didn’t have enough budget for alien costumes), and when the aliens heal humans and share energy with them, promising to share the technology, nobody asks to teach humans those technologies, but virtually everyone is happily accepting them without an understanding of how it works. Hold on, actually that’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software">exactly</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult">what</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance">happens</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service">here</a>. Okay, they’ve captured that aspect of humanity pretty well, but then there are obvious cheap movie tricks, almost as bad as in <a href="/articles/video/star-wars.html">Star Wars</a>: even though the antagonists are dull and acting stupid, you can’t sympathize the protagonists even if you try: most of them are robotic and unpleasant like tech support (or those cyborg spammers, if there is a difference). Good folks are pretty, bad ones are ugly or lay slimy eggs, and they just disappear when they die (what they are doing all the time) – as usual. It seems to be separated from the floor of comics-based movies just by the thin layer of Star Wars.</p>
<p>But it makes one to think how come that they are so bad in making the script any convincing. Reminds of Nigerian spammers, street cons, and other online and offline scam, be those single letters or long acquaintances, making one to question whether there’s another layer of manipulation going on, or the scammers are just that dumb.</p>
<p>Of course, screenwriters and directors are supposed to manipulate your feelings, and buying it is what helps one to enjoy a movie, but this one is quite hard to stay involved in. Apparently that’s what gave rise to weird <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_%282009_TV_series%29#Interpretation">interpretations</a> of the series: when something is so obviously fake or empty, one just tries to find something else there – as a melody in noise “music”, anything that makes sense in David Lynch movies, or images when your eyes are closed. A human mind refuses to accept that a plot that bad can exist, and to be written by another sentient human being. Some even learn to enjoy such things, like those weirdos with religious books, or arthouse cinema viewers – just reading the bits that don’t make sense as metaphors to whatever they want those to mean. I think I understand them better now: you really get plenty of random thoughts while watching such a movie – like pitying the actors who have to play in those scenes, wondering what they are thinking, how did they end up performing there, how they’ll explain it to themselves or others, whether or not they are hooked on heroin by the director, or did the directors mix up the plot with a porn movie, leading to a particularly interesting porn there somewhere.</p>
<p>Here is just one little scene: the emotionless alien queen puts on an evil grin right after convincing the surrounding people that she is sad. Since it’s hard to imagine that the screenwriter thought something like “it isn’t enough that we show every 2-3 minutes how evil and emotionless she is: the viewers may think that she is actually sad in this scene, what would contradict everything that happened during the previous 30 minutes; let’s add one more evil grin, even though it doesn’t make sense for an emotionless alien lizard in human skin to grin at all”, one tries to find an explanation that makes sense. Unless you are willing to search for hidden messages or get into other kinds of crackpottery, the easiest solution here is to keep in mind that one can never underestimate people. Or maybe the writers are just angry and/or misanthropic, saying “that’s how stupid I think you are”. That’s what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art">art</a> is about, sometimes – conveying a message, not just making amusing things. It may seem dull, since a message can be written clearly and in plain text instead, but the important aspect here is that you have to digest it yourself, while the piece of art serves as an illustration, which makes you to think. Like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method">Socratic method</a>.</p>
<p>Alien culture is rarely elaborated and different enough from human cultures in sci-fi, but in V it’s one of the worst: though it’s mostly absent, the “V” symbol is used in the few bits that are present, making those contradictory to the whole setting, or implying another highly unlikely coincidence.</p>
<p>No interesting or fun characters there, pretty much every character is rather annoying. The story, if you cut out all the nonsense, is absent.</p>
<p>On the “sci” part of “sci-fi”, it’s even worse: there are plot-critical recurring events such as DNA “extraction” (it is unclear what they mean by that, but the purpose seems to be just a collection) using thousands of needles, without putting the patients to sleep, and making it a torture, while they can heal (and even revive) patients without touching them. It’s somewhat like in The Matrix, which was dumbed down by replacing human brain usage for computational power with human body usage for heat, except that in V it probably already was that way in the original script. Hackerman-style hackers are also present in the series, of course, together with other movie cliches. There is plenty of implausible events happening, along with implicit assumptions that we’re getting all the physics and biology (one can count mathematics too, because of Hackerman characters) wrong, and without any alternative models or explanations provided, making it more like magic-fiction. Or, perhaps, science-themed trash-fiction.</p>

  <p>Previously on <a href="https://github.com/pimp-my-code">Pimp My Code</a>: <a href="https://github.com/muennich">muennich</a> got his brand new <a href="https://github.com/muennich/sxiv">sxiv</a> repository <a href="https://github.com/muennich/sxiv/pull/116">pimped</a>. Now he’s enjoying <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/">GNU Guile</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Build_System">GNU Build System</a>, and fetches images directly from the Internet.</p>
<p>Today Victor Frankenstein comes to visit <a href="https://github.com/getlogbook/logbook">logbook</a> and its owners.</p>
<p><strong>Victor</strong>: Yo, now we’re going to visit logbook’s authors who aren’t totally happy with their library. Here they are, on github – let’s knock.</p>
<p><em>The door opens, Roman shows up and looks shocked.</em></p>
<p><strong>Roman</strong>: Is it you? Is it really you? OMG, OMG! I can’t believe it!</p>
<p><strong>Victor</strong>: Hell yeah, nice to see you Roman! I heard you need some help with your code, is that right?</p>
<p><strong>Roman</strong>: Aah, yes! It’s so old, I’ve actually got it from my grandma.</p>
<p><strong>Victor</strong>: Let’s see what you have there!</p>
<p><strong>Roman</strong>: Sure, here it is. It’s pretty much in the same condition as it was when I’ve got it, I’ve only tried to cover it with tests occasionally, to keep it going, you know.</p>
<p><strong>Victor</strong>: Oh, I see. Plenty of tests you’ve got there. Hey, who are <a href="https://github.com/getlogbook/logbook/blob/master/AUTHORS">those fellows</a>?</p>
<p><strong>Roman</strong>: Those are my comrades, we usually write and use logbook together. That’s Armin and George, they’ve actually done most of the tinkering.</p>
<p><strong>Armin and George</strong>: Hello Victor!</p>
<p><strong>Victor</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>Roman</strong>: And here are Ronny, Daniel, Kenneth, Valentine, and others. Actually they’ve sent a note to you in the first place, asking for help.</p>
<p><strong>Victor</strong>: Well, good friends you have there! Now tell me guys, what do you want to see changed about this library?</p>
<p><strong>Armin</strong>: See all those tests? We’ve collected plenty of those with time.</p>
<p><strong>Victor</strong>: Yeah, we definitely should clean those up. What else?</p>
<p><strong>George</strong>: You know how logging is supposed to inform you about errors? But when there’s an error in logging, what’s especially easy to get in these Python libraries, you kind of get screwed – hence all those tests. I don’t know, but maybe something can be done about it?</p>
<p><strong>Victor</strong>: That’s tricky, but our mechanic will take a look at it – we’ll figure something out. Okay, guys, I’m getting it to our garage – see you later!</p>
<p><strong>Logbook authors</strong>: Yaay!</p>
<p><em>Victor arrives to the garage, El Hackerozo doesn’t approve of what Victor has brought in this time.</em></p>
<p><strong>El Hackerozo</strong>: Come on, man, is it Python? What are we supposed to do with it? Does it look like we got space around here to set up any additional virtual environments?</p>
<p><strong>Victor</strong>: It’s not that bad, it was maintained.</p>
<p><strong>El Hackerozo</strong>: Seriously? Look at that test suite, it barely prevents the whole library from collapsing into an infinite loop.</p>
<p><strong>Victor</strong>: Look, it only proves that we’re the only ones who can help them out! Let’s see what we can fix here, okay?</p>
<p><em>Victor explains other details and the team begins planning.</em></p>
<p><strong>Victor</strong>: So, I figured that their logger needs logging. We’ll reuse the existing mechanics for that, making it recursive – just increasing the threshold on each level to make it self-terminate to avoid infinite loops. But something still needs to be done about how it looks. Also don’t forget about those tests!</p>
<p><strong>El Hackerozo</strong>: Okay, I can repaint the icon completely, perhaps add some flames to make it move faster, and lint the code a bit.</p>
<p><strong>Victor</strong>: Let’s do this!</p>
<p><em>The team works on it for hours. The test suite looks really gross after being extracted from the main code tree, guys pack it into big black bags.</em></p>
<p><strong>Victor</strong>: Let’s see what we’ve got here!</p>

<p><strong>Victor</strong>: Now is the time to show it to our clients!</p>
<p><em>El Hackerozo plays with a part of the eradicated tests.</em></p>
<p><em>The logbook authors come in, <a href="https://github.com/getlogbook/logbook/pull/201">the team presents the work</a>:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yo dawg!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I heard you like logging. Every logger logs. But not every logger is logging what it’s logging while it’s logging. So we’ve put logging into your logger, to log what it’s logging while it’s logging!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>While that gets logged, it also logs what it’s logging – recursively. But it also terminates! No more silent errors in your logging.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Hold on, hold on! That’s not the only thing we’ve improved! Your icon has been updated with screaming new design: flame vinyl that reflects its performance, bookmark, more expensive wood and converted to SVG from plain old boring PNG! While it’s new, we’ve tried to preserve its soul – so it will remind you of all those good times from the previous life of your nifty little library.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Why don’t you try to zoom it in and out? See, it’s vector, no pixels! That’s the latest technologies right here, just for you!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We had to perform some heavy cleaning to get rid of those rusty tests you’ve collected in it, but see – no tests anymore! Don’t be afraid of bugs anymore: with this beauty, you can write terabyte after terabyte of logs, without a need to pause. Did I mention that it accelerates from 0 to 100 MB/s in 3 seconds? Be careful with this babe!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>All your favorite handlers are still there, of course. Just pick one and take a stab!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Roman</strong>: OMG, OMG! Is it really our logbook?!</p>
<p><strong>Armin</strong>: Ahh, look at this beauty!</p>
<p><strong>George</strong>: Whoo-hoo!</p>
<p><strong>Victor</strong>: Yeah, yeah, do you even recognize your old library?</p>
<p><strong>Valentine</strong>: Holy <em>beep</em>! Is it logging?</p>
<p><strong>Victor</strong>: Yeah, we’ve put logging into your logger! Wanna see it in action?</p>
<p><strong>Daniel</strong>: Heck yeah!</p>
<p><strong>Victor</strong>: <a href="/exhaust/pimp-my-code-logbook.txt">Observe</a>!</p>
<p><strong>Ronny</strong>: I can’t believe it, you’ve actually made it to log what it’s logging!</p>
<p><strong>El Hackerozo</strong>: Right, no more silent errors, and no need in those rusty tests. Do you like the new looks?</p>
<p><strong>Frazer</strong>: It’s awesome! Can you take a photo of me with it?</p>
<p><strong>Victor</strong>: You also get our badge, indicating that your project has been officially pimped. We’ve also cleaned up all the inferior badges you’ve had there!</p>
<p><strong>Ronny</strong>: This is awesome! Thank you so much, Pimp My Code!</p>
<p><strong>Raphaël</strong>: Holy <em>beep</em>, guys, all the handlers are still there!</p>
<p><strong>Victor</strong>: That’s right. We figured you like them.</p>
<p><strong>Roman</strong>: Thank you!</p>
<p><strong>Victor</strong>: It was Pimp My Code on The Asocial, see you next time!</p>

<div id="article">
  <p>This new century presents new threats to our society, not least of which is the spread of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_number">illegal numbers</a>: numbers which are dangerous by themselves, or those that can be interpreted as dangerous information. Pretty much any number falls into the second group, and unfortunately we can’t ban them all yet, so only individual numbers are currently prohibited in the civilized world. A police officer agreed to give us an interview on this topic.</p>
<p><strong>The Asocial (A)</strong>: We’re all set. Could you briefly explain to our audience the dangers of illegal numbers?</p>
<p><strong>Police Officer (P)</strong>: Sure. Illegal numbers, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_prime">illegal primes</a> in particular, undermine the values on which our society is built. One day kids play with them, the next day they hijack an airplane to get more.</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: Um, how are airplanes related?</p>
<p><strong>P</strong>: Airplanes are valuable, and illegal numbers are expensive on black market – especially prime ones. Just this month we’ve raided a dealer, extracted enough money to buy a few islands.</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: I heard they are very careful, using cryptocurrencies and mixing services, operating over Tor, shipping with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_drop">dead drops</a>, and so on. How do you catch them?</p>
<p><strong>P</strong>: Lots of surveillance, statistics, and analytics – quite an interesting process, actually. Though sometimes they just make mistakes, such as using the same place for a dead drop twice.</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: Okay, could you describe typical dealers and consumers?</p>
<p><strong>P</strong>: Yeah, it’s quite simple: the dealers are all the same – be those number dealers, drug dealers, furniture dealers, or whatever: just some poor bastards who can’t do better, and don’t care. But the consumers are the real problem: those are disgusting low-life criminals without any morals. That’s why the punishment for possession is more severe than that for transmission alone.</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: How do you tell if one is in a possession of an illegal number?</p>
<p><strong>P</strong>: Numbers can be stored on laptops, usb sticks, phones, and so on. With phones and most of the laptops it’s pretty easy: NSA performs the required checks to ensure that those are clear. If we see a suspicious usb stick, or an untracked laptop, we can extract it and send to an expertise.</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: What about the numbers that contain illegal ones? Like, the same bits, the same digits in their decimal representation, especially if a decimal representation is infinite, or just being larger than the illegal ones – containing them by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set-theoretic_definition_of_natural_numbers">the set-theoretic definition</a>.</p>
<p><strong>P</strong>: Currently it is unclear what to do with those, but if you ask me – those real and complex numbers are quite shady even without illegal ones. Pretty much everything can be solved by whitelisting allowed numbers instead of blacklisting illegal ones: limiting them to natural numbers, such as 0, 1, 2, 3… The next one is banned in China, but that’s enough for all the real-world tasks. And it should be prohibited to put them together, sum them, or do any other tricks, of course.</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: Okay, thanks for clarifying that to us.</p>
<p><strong>P</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p>As one may see, the taxes don’t get wasted on something silly like mathematical research, but rather getting spent on the safety of citizens.</p>

<div id="article">
  <p>Do not talk to your neighbors. Lock your doors and turn off the lights. Sit tight, prepare yourself for a piece of information that is destined to blow your mind.</p>
<p>Today we will review not just a movie, but the life itself… life of a mentally retarded adult who has spent most part of his life in prison. This small Hollywood masterpiece gives a good insight into the world of an average mid-west hick town and shows the simple life in all its glory.</p>
<p>Karl, convicted at a young age for murdering his mother and her lover, after doing his time finally gets released back into society full of loving and caring individuals. He is a free man now. After many years spent in solidarity where he was sharing his time with books, it seems to be that he turned into the smartest guy in town. Nobody knows who he is and what he’s all about, only the story about a guy who killed his parents with a sling blade goes around in that lil’ ol’ town.</p>
<p>After befriending the second smartest human being in town, a young boy named Frank, he ends up getting a bed at a very hostile and violent home. Back in the 90’s people couldn’t predict well that a man who got convicted for killing his own mother with a blade in an attempt to protect her from what he saw as evil, would ever kill anyone again in an attempt to protect a close person. Thanks to movies like this, even people in mid-west now tend to be more aware of possible patterns in human behavior.</p>
<p>The dialect in the movie portraits with high precision the way frequent Wal-Mart customers communicate with one another. The movie surely teaches people about the right way of taking care of one another, with all that bringing food in bed and sharing same loaf of bread. Just like in the good ol’ days…</p>
<p>The secondary characters are important as well. The most prominent would be the overly social guy who was feeding Karl truly amazing stories about his (mis)fortunate sexual adventures. Although, it might not be the brightest idea to be talking about those things with someone who killed his mother and her lover for having sex together. But it’s a movie, no one in it can predict what’s going to happen in the next ninety minutes or so.</p>
<p>Sometimes Karl appears to be lonesome. But he’s not. He’s got his books and a giant collection of dirty stories that he heard from that strange hospital fellar. Nevertheless, the controlling and emotionally abusive head of the household, Linda, attempts to arrange a blind date for him and the only person who would ever consider getting involved with a mentally impaired person: an overweight female co-worker with social skills of software developer. Things do not seem to be working out since Karl’s posture and, despite the time spent listening to teachings of his “sex guru”, lack of sexual experience, could not overcome the complications of accomplishing intercourse with an overly big lady.</p>
<p>Linda’s boyfriend Doyle, a local rock-star and the only real man in town sometimes acts a bit aggressive. Although such behavior doesn’t seem to surprise or bother anyone in mid-west, her son, who seems to be more out of picture in that nowhere town than the main character, either due to having watched too much television while visiting the local laundromat or the fact of not falling a victim of a curse named general education, one night picks a fight and kicks Linda’s boyfriend out. The boy is most likely a latent homosexual, since he rejects an obvious masculine father figure and prefers to have a retard as someone to look up to. In one of the scenes we’re being shown his lousy attempt of hitting up after a rich girl of his age. It can be clearly seen as a trivial way to forgive himself for own sexuality, therefore blame his choice on lack of success with women at the age of twelve. And no, he did not forget to bring his bubba along with him when he was asking a girl out. Smooth. Despite that, being a stubborn little boy that he is, Frank rejects another father figure, Vaughan, who is 33.7% out of the closet himself. Karl is the father he always wanted to have: who if not the person who killed his family and spent 25 years in jail can teach a young boy how to survive in modern America.</p>
<p>Sling Blade features a few prominent musical tracks, such as the song that Doyle sings for the whole town during his free midnight live performance with his band of five very talented jazz players. This draws a parallel with how similar Doyle’s situation is comparing to Karl’s: one is unable to share his talents because of being unjustly stuck in the wrong place, while the other is unable to open himself up to let people know how much of a great guy he is due to mental impairment.</p>
<p>The story ends with Karl, being unable to compete with Frank’s machismo, decides to get rid of the rival. Ending up back at the same window in his old hospital, listening to another story of his misadventurous story-teller who clearly has no clue about social borders.</p>
<p>This movie teaches us a lot. It teaches us love and ability to forgive, gives us a glimpse at poetry and music of simple American folk. It is definitely not a movie to forget. I am just not certain if I was more happy to discover this magnificent picture or with the fact that I do not live in mid-west.</p>

<div id="article">
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lobster">The Lobster</a> is a movie made by a few European countries, but reminds primarily of French movies – such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrong_%28film%29">Wrong</a>, for instance, though that one is French-American. Somehow their French parts take over all the time: perhaps that’s because they are distinguishably weird and absurd, and look like they are made by kids alone. Plot, sound effects, perhaps even acting – pretty much everything looks that way. They are “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_film">independent</a>” most of the time, tend to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealism">surreal</a> and full of metaphors (or just some random stuff that can be interpreted as you wish; metaphors suck), and characters act even more stupid than those in Hollywood horror movies.</p>
<p>This movie is not an exception, and it is also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystopia">dystopian</a>, what may make it more or less worthwhile to spend your time on watching. Though its sound effects are really bad and loud, and it is long, as many other boring movies tend to be: most of the 2-hour movies barely have enough of the plot for 10-30 minutes, and many independent films actually are 10-30 minutes long. Probably sometimes they are like “hey, we have more tape left – let’s make it longer”, or “let’s not cut anything, it’s too wasteful to throw away our work”.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to watch it is in background – that is, with another window over it. And definitely without sound, since it is very bad and loud, as was mentioned above. Another option is just to turn it off and remove altogether at the moment when it’ll cross your mind: the movie doesn’t get better as it progresses.</p>
<p>Usually I am seeding a lot, or at least until the 1.0 ratio if a movie is bad, but removed this one as soon as I finished watching it, and felt good about doing so. I feel fooled and robbed of time, so don’t repeat my mistakes.</p>
