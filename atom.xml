<div id="article">
  <p>Somewhere in the bottom hemisphere, among koalas and wombats, a guy once thought: “this civilization sucks”. But instead of whining on the internet, he went into a forest, methodologically and silently building everything from scratch (i.e., without modern tools) out of mud and sticks. And videotaping it.</p>
<p>Or maybe he liked the civilization so much that he wanted to learn how to rebuild it if something will go wrong. Or to role-play like those Amish people do, or as a religious thing, as Tolkien fans practice. Or to explore living independently from society, as Ted Kaczynski tried before exploring living in a prison. As a hobby or as a way to make some money, as an art project, as a bet, to show off, or whatever: there is a lot of perfectly valid reasons to go alone into a forest and start building everything out of mud, but we don’t know which one it was, because he doesn’t blabber in the videos. Okay, actually he writes that <a href="https://primitivetechnology.wordpress.com/about/">it’s a hobby</a>, but could have been about anything.</p>
<p>It’s not just some dull stuff like stone tools, huts, and dress (though that too), but he also harnesses the fire, making pots, charcoal, chimneys, kilns, furnaces. No metal (not even copper) tools yet, but there is a bit of smelting experimentation, so he’s somewhere at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic">Neolithic Era</a> level of development (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_historic_inventions">timeline of historic inventions</a> for an outline). It’s probably a long way from that to fancy stuff like any usable electronics, radio, and computers, even with the modern knowledge (but without modern physical tools or prepared materials), but the guy is fairly young, and probably has enough time for that ahead of him.</p>
<p>The videos are quite impressive and interesting to watch, and probably it’s fun to work on: even though sometimes it takes hours to make a single hole in a log, it still looks more fun than to waste hours/days/months/years doing nothing in particular. And then he gets a log with a hole in it!</p>
<p>As was mentioned, the guy is silent in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAL3JXZSzSm8AlZyD3nQdBA/videos">the videos</a> (what makes them similar to creepy videos where other silent people do other weird stuff; anonymously until recently, too, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_Technology">as wikipedia says</a>), but there are subtitles that explain what’s going on, what are the immediate goals of his actions. They are pretty informative, so don’t forget to run <code>youtube-dl</code> with the <code>--write-sub</code> option in order to grab subtitles along with the videos. The blog contains additional information on the projects.</p>

<div id="article">
  <p>Music discovery is one of those activities with which a huge network with tons of information may be helpful. Unfortunately, the one we’ve got here mostly sucks, and about the best we get is the same radios as before, just using new technologies. “But wait!” you may object. “We have youtube, and last.fm, and myspace”. Well, yeah, but they are inefficient, with no way to improve them, and belong to the world of ads and misery. We’re not heading there.</p>
<p>Then there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilation_album">compilation albums</a>, which may work for discovery, but the concept of an album is an artifact from the previous century, and particularly from the pre-internet part of it – when they just had to store a collection of songs using a single physical object, and to transfer the songs with it. They had radios and phones even then, but the quality of transmitted sound was far from that of original records.</p>
<p>Actually there is a variety of ways to discover music, but listening to internet radios is one of them, so let’s finally get to that.</p>
<h2 id="finding-radios">Finding radios</h2>
<p>A naive internet user may try to find a decent radio by typing “internet radio” into a web search engine, but they are bound to discover loads of unusable—and often paywalled—crap that way. Individual stations are made invisible by huge services, and the huge services require monetization of their own.</p>
<p>The solution is similar to that with software: one has to dive into the geekier depths of internet to find some enthusiasts who are trying to provide bullshit-free services. Those tend to hang around relevant technologies, mostly software in this case. Let’s see: FSF’s <a href="https://www.fsf.org/campaigns/playogg/en/">PlayOgg!</a> leads us to <a href="https://xiph.org/">xiph.org</a>, which provides a <a href="http://dir.xiph.org/">streaming directory</a>: a list of active streams with basic search and direct links to both playlists and the stations’ websites. Done.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
<p>The streams we saw announce themselves using “<a href="http://www.icecast.org/docs/icecast-2.4.1/yp.html">Yellow Pages</a>”. In case if you have ever wondered how media streaming works, it is as disappointing as most of the other human-made stuff. In most cases, it uses the same protocol that is used (and intended) to serve web pages, to serve data in the same formats as used for locally stored files. There’s just a bit of math involved in sound compression, but no magic around it otherwise. There is some patents-related mess when it comes to codecs though, and inconsistencies in software support, of course. For those interested in technical bits, <a href="https://xiph.org/">xiph.org</a> provides nice entry-level explanations and documentation.</p>
<p>Regarding the overall operation, one can go through “about” sections of the listed radio stations. Some are regular radio stations with in-air ads, some accept donations and/or stick to indie bands that are happy to get promoted for free, and some are not exactly law-abiding. What leads us to the legal aspect of their working: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_licensing">music licensing</a> is <a href="https://www.boutell.com/newfaq/creating/musicrights.html">a pain, and an expensive one</a> (the linked page is composed by the guy who <a href="https://boutell.com/newfaq/browser/needjavaandjavascript.html">claims</a> that JavaScript makes web browsing <em>less</em> painful, but probably he is not always wrong) – even when it is for non-commercial playback.</p>
<p>Basically, people keep succeeding in complicating essentially simple things.</p>

  <p><a href="https://blog.naev.org/">Naev</a> is a space-themed adventure/RPG kind of game, akin to <a href="https://endless-sky.github.io/">endless sky</a> (2D top-down graphics, too) and somewhat similar to <a href="/articles/games/oolite.html">oolite</a>.</p>
<p>The game features trading, combat, flights, and missions that are about trading, combat, and flights. The game also features lots of stars and planets, space ships, equipment, factions. All those things are made quite well, as is the overall game, comparing to other similar libre games.</p>
<p>It is not particularly original, or fun, or anything, yet a fine game to kill some time with. The build process is nice and painless, it neither crashes nor hogs resources, the graphics and controls are fine: looks like the authors either knew what they are doing, or at least weren’t lazy to learn along the way (which is at least 10 years of development, with more than 13 thousand commits).</p>

  <p><em>You may have noticed that we didn’t write much in the past few months. That’s because we’ve been saving our quarterly profanity quota to write about Cloudflare.</em></p>
<p>“Synergy” is a word famous for being abused by useless people, yet it would serve well to describe what combination of Cloudflare with everything connected to it is: a few pieces of shit, the combination of which is a greater piece of shit than the sum of each separately. Or, to put in a more straightforward way, Cloudflare is a shit amplifier.</p>
<p>Consider Google: it milks its users for private information, sells them to spammers (aka advertisers), tries to track others and do the same to them, but fails because JavaScript is disabled and Google hosts are blocked, so everyone’s sort of happy. But combined with Cloudflare by the use of Google’s captcha service, it gives users an ultimatum if one wants to visit a Cloudflare-encumbered website: either get tracked and sold to spammers, or become an image-clustering monkey working for free for Google. Supposedly Google doesn’t even pay Cloudflare for that: CF are just happy to screw their users in one more way.</p>
<p>Security with Cloudflare is a circus: just look at “<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ssl/">Cloudflare One-Click SSL</a>”. Of course they call both X.509 and TLS “SSL”, but there’s much more. The use of non-vulnerable TLS versions is just optional, as the page claims. The “Flexible SSL” mode means “pretend that there is encryption”, making it to look like the connection is safe, while it is plaintext between Cloudflare and an actual server. The “Full SSL” mode is a MitM attack performed by Cloudflare itself. Oh, <a href="https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2017/02/cloudflare-data-leak/">look</a>, “Cloudflare has experienced a data leak over a 5 month period that mixed sensitive data between websites and visitors” – who would have thought! Actively broken security combined with evidently half-assed job turns out to lead to actual leaks. They keep going with a patch and no substantial changes after that, of course.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloudflare#Criticism_and_controversies">criticism listed in Wikipedia</a> doesn’t even cover those, but mentions <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_contract">pink contracts</a> and such; indeed, spammers seem to like Cloudflare, as do other scammers.</p>
<p>The only good thing about Cloudflare is that it lists the largest companies that are foolish enough to trust them, so one can use that to find out what to avoid. They tend to list the numbers of clients (“internet properties”, as they call them) as well, in an attempt to exploit at least two common fallacies: appeals <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority">to authority</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum">to the people</a>.</p>
<p>The Wikipedia article mentions that they’ve got some dumb award from TechCrunch. Why don’t we assign awards though? Cloudflare is hereby awarded with our new “fraud of the year” award.</p>
<p>P.S. The public mail service we were using, vivaldi.net, has — in its infinite wisdom — effectively blocked our account as a response to the Cloudflare leak. If you’ve sent anything there in the past year or so, use our updated contacts to resend it.</p>

<p>With <a href="https://openttd.org/">OpenTTD</a>, one can enjoy train business simulation using a personal computer, with no need of actually getting into train business!</p>
<p>That’s another libre clone<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> of an older game, with some additional development on top of that. One of the cutting-edge technologies that OpenTTD applies is an additional sensory output: not just you see and hear trains, but you can also smell the burning dirt – supposedly from a video card. Not like there are any fancy graphics, so it can’t be a mere side effect.</p>
<p>Apart from trains, it includes some busses, ships, and aircraft. You build roads, airports, and other stuff, collect money, build more – in a loop. With no way of enjoying what you’ve earned, or any meaningful goal: that’s how good it is at simulating a train entrepreneur’s life.</p>

  <p><a href="https://wl.widelands.org/">Widelands</a> is a libre remake — with further development — of an older RTS game Settlers II, focused mainly on building a sustainable and efficient economy, and a little on warfare. There is a variety of resources and buildings, and a player can apply different development strategies.</p>
<p>The first stage of playing it boils down to figuring how it works, what resources and buildings are needed, in what order to build them, etc. Then it’s mostly about perfecting the same strategy. Well, not very different from what one does in most of the other games: acquiring a useless skill, and applying it then.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of maps, some campaigns, and multiplayer is present over both direct connection and a game server.</p>
<p>The game is implemented quite well: as in <a href="/articles/games/wesnoth.html">The Battle for Wesnoth</a>, the graphics here are dated, yet generally it is nice and polished. Though its build process relies on custom shell scripts, but at least they work – so building from sources should not be a problem.</p>

  <p>More and more often overweight people are getting stuck in bathtubs<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, sometimes <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/3mD4u">requiring assistance</a> to get released. Surprisingly, both the causes and the mechanisms differ from case to case.</p>
<p>Following the rumors of another overweight guy being stuck in a bathtub, The Asocial interviews the poor fatty himself:</p>
<p><strong>The Asocial (TA)</strong>: Hello, fatty. May I call you that?</p>
<p><strong>Fat Guy (FA)</strong>: I wouldn’t call a person who weights 125 kilograms “fatty”. But I do deem those of a lower weight underweight.</p>
<p><strong>TA</strong>: Interesting world view. How long have you been stuck in the bathtub?</p>
<p><strong>FA</strong>: To be honest, just a few seconds total, but more than once. The whole time I’ve been in control of being stuck, though the second to last didn’t go exactly as planned. Besides, it was rather a suction, I wasn’t literally “stuck”.</p>
<p><strong>TA</strong>: Oh, that is not so bad. But I heard you’ve performed some physical experiments during that time, is that correct?</p>
<p><strong>FA</strong>: More like the other way around: sometimes I’d get stuck while performing physical experiments.</p>
<p><strong>TA</strong>: Could you elaborate on the nature of those experiments?</p>
<p><strong>FA</strong>: Well, I was about to take a bath. Once I’ve sat in the middle of the bathtub, I managed to block the water flow from one half to the other.</p>
<p><strong>TA</strong>: So you could pretend that you’re a human dam while playing with rubber ducks?</p>
<p><strong>FA</strong>: Yes. And I did!</p>
<p><strong>TA</strong>: But how did you manage to eventually get stuck in there?</p>
<p><strong>FA</strong>: One of my favourite scenarios that I’m playing while pretending to be a dam is an earthquake. So I’ve started to wiggle to emulate it, but that has created a vacuum under my back, and that’s how I got stuck. Then I began researching this effect, and found a position that maximized the vacuum. It even was painful to get unstuck at that point. So I had to get rid of the vacuum, but don’t ask me how.</p>
<p><strong>TA</strong>: Okay, how did you first discover that you can block water flow with your body?</p>
<p><strong>FA</strong>: Once upon a time I’ve sat in the middle of a bathtub, turned the tap on, and behind me there was little water. It was cold, and the water was hot. Then I’ve noticed that the water behind me doesn’t go up, while it does in front of me, and quite fast. Then I figured that I was a dam, and moved forward, what sped up the water level increase rate. Quite an interesting observation that was.</p>
<p><strong>TA</strong>: And what is the purpose of those experiments?</p>
<p><strong>FA</strong>: The question of purpose is rather complex to me, I don’t know the purpose of my actions in general. Except for the basic ones – such as sleeping, eating, getting the food. So I guess it could be best described as plain curiosity. But isn’t it the curiosity that leads us to the most interesting of discoveries? Particularly with one’s own body.</p>
<p><strong>TA</strong>: Probably it is. Is it why you became, hrm, non-underweight?</p>
<p><strong>FA</strong>: No, I’ve chosen to be this way because I’ve got a full-time programming job and a car. A programmer’s salary is high, so I was able to try various foods out of curiosity. I could be doing that virtually all day long.</p>
<p><strong>TA</strong>: I see. By the way, while I’m here, a colleague of mine asked me to find out whether fat shaming really works. What’s your take on that?</p>
<p><strong>FA</strong>: Nope, actually it’s the other way around: I’m proud of my fat and quite happy about it. Particularly while running or camping. By the time when underweight weaklings get exhausted, falling on the ground and freezing, I’m still full of energy; my fat provides that for me.</p>
<p><strong>TA</strong>: Are you eating those weaklings then?</p>
<p><strong>FA</strong>: Also when I’m running a quarter marathon or a half marathon, it’s the same. I’m barely preparing, while they are running a few times per week. For them it’s an offence and humiliation when the fat guy runs on par with them. The last time I’ve got the third place among girls.</p>
<p><strong>TA</strong>: So, contrary to the stereotypes, fatness basically gives you superhuman powers.</p>
<p><strong>FA</strong>: It just so happened that I didn’t register for the marathon, but my girlfriend did. I decided to support her and ran along with her. But at some point she got tired and gave me her tracker. I’ve managed to get the third place in the women’s marathon, so my girlfriend got a medal, a flask, two 17-litre bottles of water, and 25 hamburgers</p>
<p><strong>TA</strong>: That’s interesting, and our readers may be curious: how did you get a girlfriend while being fat?</p>
<p><strong>FA</strong>: Well, I was her boss. Or, rather, a team leader.</p>
<p><strong>TA</strong>: And ordered to become your girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>FA</strong>: Not exactly, though one could say so. We were walking a lot during work hours, and…</p>
<p><strong>TA</strong>: Okay, stop right there, that gets boring. Have you been stuck in any other places before?</p>
<p><strong>FA</strong>: Yes, I have. Once my girlfriend and I went to a mountain trip. She wanted to see the mountains, but I’ve got stuck on a beach in a cafe. I’ve ordered a large portion of a local dish there, but wasn’t able to eat it all – it was intended to be shared among a company, weighting 1200 grams. But by the end of our vacation I was able to eat it in one go.</p>
<p><strong>TA</strong>: You’ve got stuck there just figuratively speaking, right?</p>
<p><strong>FA</strong>: No, I’d say “mentally”. It’s hard to say “no” to food.</p>
<p><strong>TA</strong>: But what about being stuck physically?</p>
<p><strong>FA</strong>: No, not recalling.</p>
<p><strong>TA</strong>: So that was a new experience for you this time. Are you planning on repeating it in the future?</p>
<p><strong>FA</strong>: Not likely: I’ll have to move out tomorrow, and such bathtubs are uncommon around here.</p>
<p><strong>TA</strong>: Do you know any other non-underweight people who are getting stuck in bathtubs on purpose? Is it like a subculture thing?</p>
<p><strong>FA</strong>: No, but I think they can be forced to.</p>
<p><strong>TA</strong>: “Forced”? Why would you even consider that?</p>
<p><strong>FA</strong>: Technically they are able to, but they are not curious enough about their bodies. So if they were given a purpose, they could definitely do it.</p>
<p><strong>TA</strong>: Any words of encouragement to our readers?</p>
<p><strong>FA</strong>: I don’t think that body fat is any special. Everyone has got enough fat. And if one treats it with care and love, a splendid belly may grow out of it. Or an ass.</p>
<p><strong>TA</strong>: Exciting.</p>
<p>A historical note: fat people predate bathtubs, but they were not taken into account when bathtubs were designed. Some speculate that it’s simply because they’ve required more materials than needed for an average person, but there is a conspiracy theory or two providing alternative explanations.</p>

  <p>Currently there is just 4 websites between Wikipedia and world domination, and we are reviewing those four.

</blockquote>
<p>Well, at least it’s in English. Note that there is no permission to get a resource that is an error page according to its URL, not the one we were looking for. As if it wasn’t bad enough, the message also claims that there is no permission to get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator">URL</a>, not the resource it refers to.</p>

<div id="article">
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackadder">Blackadder</a> is a four-season-and-a-few-extras historical series, with each season being set in a different (yet recent) century. Some historians believe that it contains real footage, but the mainstream opinion is that it’s just old, yet not old enough to contain that.</p>
<p>It follows the adventures of Edmund Blackadder and his loyal servant Baldrick, along with a few recurring secondary characters. From season to season, the intelligence appears to drift from Baldrick to Blackadder somehow, while Edmund’s social status declines, yet some of the character traits always stay there.</p>
<p><em>As a side note, there is a strange appeal in writing vague nonsense while reviewing something: probably that’s how all those movie summaries come into existence, and not because their authors don’t even care to watch the movies they are writing about.</em></p>
<p>The characters are quite fun, and the cast includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowan_Atkinson">Mr. Bean</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Laurie">Dr. House</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/fry/">the gNewSense guy</a> who <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Fry#Computing_and_software_freedom">secretly uses</a> <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/ubuntu-spyware.en.html">Ubuntu</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldrick">Baldrick</a> (cameo appearance), and some less famous folks.</p>
<p>One of its prominent features is the depiction of the most cunning plans throughout the history: “as cunning as a fox what used to be Professor of Cunning at Oxford University but has moved on and is now working for the U.N. at the High Commission of International Cunning Planning”, for instance. Not all of them have worked out though.</p>
<p>Another nice thing to note about Blackadder is its realism: nobody develops an unlikely friendship there.</p>

  <p>About a year ago we have <a href="/articles/internet/alexa-top-500-filtered.html">filtered top 500 websites</a> in order to get the trash out of the list, and observe what’s there on the internet. Now we are doing it again, and observing how it changes.</p>
<p>The filter criteria are roughly the same as before: no fraud, social networks, politics, pornography, country-specific and company websites, trading, heavy surveillance, and other kinds of crap. It is not guaranteed to be consistent with the last year’s list, since websites change, perception changes, and we could have missed some of those previously. This time we’ve got 31 website again – 6.2% that are tolerable:</p>
